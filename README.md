[![GitHub version][badge-github-version-image]][badge-npm-url] [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/scriptwerx/grunt-codename.svg)](https://david-dm.org/scriptwerx/grunt-codename) [![Built with Grunt][badge-grunt-image] ][badge-grunt-url] ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/100)

[![NPM][badge-npm-image]][badge-npm-url]

Utility to include a codename for your application based on version (up-to v10.X.X-X).

This works great alongside version bump utility: [grunt-bumpx][] for keeping your version numbers and names up-to-date with each build.

Included codenames and patchNames created with the help of the excellent [codenamegenerator.com][] website.

## Getting started

This plugin requires Grunt `~1.0.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile][] as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-codename --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-codename');
```

The project follows the [SemVer][] guidelines for version numbers; specifically following: `1.2.3-1` being `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD`.

**N.B. The supplied codenames and patchNames only include suport for single-digit numbers used for minor and patch of the *version* field (and major up to 10) - you must supply your own custom codenames and patchNames if you can't handle this restriction (but that's a lot of names)!**

## The "codename" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `codename` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
    codename: {
        options: {
            // Task-specific options go here.
        },
        src: [
            // Target-specific files go here.
        ]
	}
})
```

**codename** allows to set the codename and patchName based on the version number of the configuration files (package.json, manifest.json, etc.) in your project. Only JSON files are supported, and each file **must** have a `version` field compliant to [SemVer][] guidelines; specifically following: `1.2.3-1` being `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD`.

**Remember: The supplied codenames and patchNames only include suport for single-digit numbers used for minor and patch of the *version* field (and major up to 10) - you must supply your own custom codenames and patchNames if you can't handle this restriction (but that's a lot of names)!**

### Example JSON

**codename** is designed to update your *package.json*, *manifest.json* or any other JSON file with a *"version"* field (configured as noted above).

An example of a *manifest.json* file is below:

```json
{
	"name": "My Test Application",
	"version": "1.3.2-16",
	"codename": "",
	"patchName": "",
	"description": "A test application for me."
}
```

Once **codename** has been used (with patchNames enabled); the *manifest.json* file would be updated automatically as follows:

```json
{
	"name": "My Test Application",
	"version": "1.3.2-16",
	"codename": "Honiara Nimitz",
	"patchName": "Ithomiid",
	"description": "A test application for me."
}
```

### Options

options.* | Type | Default | Description
---|:---:|:---:|---
patch|`Boolean`|`false`|Generate a name for the *patch* version as well as the main codename.
data|`JSON`|`undefined`|Use custom JSON for the codenames (and patchNames as required).
codenames|`Object`|`undefined`|Use a custom object for codenames.
patchNames|`Object`|`undefined`|Use a custom object for patchNames.

#### Default Options
Running the task in this way, the `codename` field of each source file will be automatically changed to the correct codename for the build release.

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
    codename: {
        src: ["package.json", "manifest.json"]
    }
})
```

#### Custom Options
Running the task in this way, the `codename` and `patchName` fields of each traget file will be changed to the correct codename and patchName for the next minor release based on the names contained within the user-supplied *codenames.json* file.

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
    codename: {
        options: {
            patch: true,
            data: grunt.file.readJSON ("codenames.json")
    	},
    	src: ["package.json", "manifest.json"]
    }
})
```

### grunt-codename v0.0.6

**"Perseus Amber" (Anoa)**

* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated this documentation a little to make the current version restrictions clear.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated the demo *GruntFile.js* (included) to demonstrate our own *autoBump* method which ensures that single-digit bump occurs when using the utility.
	* When using the configuration as per our demo *GruntFile.js* bumping the *patch* part of the version will automatically switch to the *minor* part of the version and in-turn the *major* part of the version. For example (always bumping *patch*):
		* Version `0.8.8-12` becomes `0.8.9-0` which in turn becomes `0.9.0-0`.
		* Version `0.9.8-12` becomes `0.9.9-0` which in turn becomes `1.0.0-0`.
